					<p><strong>2014 TREC Conference, Microblog track</strong>. I have attended micro-blog track in 2014 TREC Conference. The track is an ad hoc task and aims at retrieve most relevant tweets from twitter based on specific queries by using given twitter collection. I built a retrieval model to modify the search result based on Lucene. The task has several specific queries, and participators should use own retrieval model through official API to generate most relevant tweets from tweet collection. Because both the queries and the tweets are short content, we need to do query expansion and tweet document expansion. We used Google API to call back the first ten Google result pages related to a query, and crawled all the ten pages' content. By using tf*idf weight, we filtered 20 most important words in all the page contents and set these words as an expansion of original queries. As for document expansion, we use Lucene to generate index for all the tweets and find out 100 other most related tweets for each tweet. We added the 100 tweets into original tweets as the document expansion. Moreover, because some tweets contained links in the content, we crawled these links content as a supplement of document. For the retrieval model, we used BM25 to calculate each tweet's score. Finally we generate tweets list.</p>

					<p><strong>Collaborative Search</strong>.I followed Professor Daqing He to create retrieval model to optimize google retrieval result in collaborative search area. We used our own system called Collaborative System to collect data. In this system, users formed groups to search a specific topic online, we can collect the group's clickthrough history, query history and snippets saved by users We then marked different types of data as different features into the retrieval model to optimize the final result. Now the project is ongoing and the basic model has been set up. </p>

					<p><strong>Vshare</strong>. Vshare is a website to help volunteers to manage their own volunteer activities, share their feelings about volunteer work and set up volunteer goals. It is a website to record all the users volunteer works. In the website, the users can manage their feelings and write down their comprehension about volunteer as well as set up new goals to inspire them do volunteer work.The website is created by myself and the project is ongoing right now.
					Technology: Html( Bootstrap), JavaScript(JQuery, D3.js), JSP, Java, SQL</p>

					<p><strong>Center for Historical Information and Analysis (CHIA)</strong>. Col*Fusion (Collaborative Data Fusion) is an advanced infrastructure for systematic accumulation, integration and utilization of historical data. It aims to support large-scale interdisciplinary research, where a comprehensive picture of the subject requires large amounts of historical data from disparate data sources from a variety of disciplines. 
					In this project, my group focused on provenance part. The main goal for us is to visualize XML file, which means if users upload an XML file, we can automatically show the keys and values as images by using open provenance model( OPM ). 
					Technologies: JavaScript(Knockout.js,JQuery), PHP,SVN,Redminel</p>
